Please note that the code repository is still under development and review.

All the notebooks will be crystalized in the coming months.

1. Most notebooks are tested with python >= 3.5 Some notebooks are tested with  python < 3.5,  mainly because of one or more packages used in it that don't have a >=3.5 equivalent . All these packages are highlighted explicitly

2. We have not covered hyper-parameter tunning in the notebooks

3. Though most notebooks are ready, its a still a work in progress.

4. For tensorflow, we have used Version 1.0. We are in the process of migrating them to the latesest tensorflow version
