Please note that the code repository is still under development and review.

All the notebooks will be crystallized in the coming months.

1. Most notebooks have been tested with Python >= 3.5 Some notebooks have been tested with Python < 3.5, mainly because they use one or more packages that don't have a >= 3.5 equivalent. All these packages have been explicitly highlighted.
2.  We have not covered hyper-parameter tuning in the notebooks.
3.  Though most notebooks are ready, it's a still a work in progress.
4.  For Tensorflow, we have used version 1.0. We are in the process of migrating them to the latest version of Tensorflow
